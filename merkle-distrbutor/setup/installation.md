# Installation

Begin by opening your terminal and ensuring you have reviewed the repository prior to cloning. After you have reviewed the repository, **run the following CLI command**.

```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/CryptoUnico/merkle-distributor merkle
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 This will create a folder named merkle at the top of your directory tree.
{% endhint %}

### Install Dependencies

After cloning, navigate to the directory and install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd merkle
$ yarn
```

#### Note on Package.json

The original scripts now include a shortcut for generating and verifying merkle roots. This may be found in the Package.json stored in the repository you cloned. Take a second to review and consider what else you may do to make working with the Merkle Airdrop repository easier for your use case.
