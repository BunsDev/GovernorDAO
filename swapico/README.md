# Swapico

- Simple, yet powerful implementation of a **swap contract** that enables you to recieve the ***authentico*** in exchange for your ***synthetico***. 
- Input the contract address and amount that you are willing to pay in exchange for an equivalent 1:1 purchase of the ***authentico*** token. 
- This contract also enables you to specify a **start time** (*inicio*), which allows you to build the front-end and include the production contract without worrying about swaps occuring sooner than anticipated.
